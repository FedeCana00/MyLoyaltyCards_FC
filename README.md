# ♠️ MyLoyaltyCards_FC iOS
It is an iOS📱 app developed in Objective-c with Xcode.
<br>
## How does it work? ⚒️
Insert your physical loyalty cards into your virtual wallet.

When the app is opened, all the cards previously inserted in a vertical list are shown.

The app allows you to add and remove loyalty cards. Each card is characterized by company name, customer code, latitude, longitude, color, logo image and barcode/QRCode.

After entering the customer code of the card, according to your preferences, an associated barcode or QRCode is generated so that it can be scanned at the cash desk.

It doesn't have a data persistence method inside!

## Why was it developed? 👨‍💻
For a second year university elective exam.
